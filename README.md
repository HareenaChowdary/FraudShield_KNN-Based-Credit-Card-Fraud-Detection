# ðŸ”’ FraudShield: KNN-Based Credit Card Fraud Detection

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
FraudShield is a **Credit Card Fraud Detection** system that applies the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm** to identify fraudulent transactions. The model analyzes transaction patterns, detects anomalies, and helps prevent financial fraud by distinguishing between genuine and suspicious transactions.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and structures transaction data for efficient analysis.
- **Fraud Detection Model**: Implements the KNN algorithm for anomaly detection.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracts meaningful transaction attributes to enhance model accuracy.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assesses model effectiveness using precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualization**: Graphical insights into fraud trends and model performance.

## ðŸ“Š Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-Learn (KNN Algorithm)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸŽ¯ Use Cases
- **Banking & Finance**: Detect fraudulent transactions and enhance security measures.
- **E-commerce**: Prevent online payment fraud and reduce chargeback losses.
- **Cybersecurity**: Strengthen fraud prevention systems in digital transactions.

## ðŸ”§ Installation & Usage
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed. Install required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```
### Running the Analysis
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HareenaChowdary/FraudShield_KNN-Based-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd FraudShield_KNN-Based-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
   ```
3. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Run the provided notebook to process data and train the KNN fraud detection model.

## ðŸ’œ Results & Insights
- Accurate fraud detection with high precision and recall.
- Fraud trends visualization for better risk assessment.
- Business-driven insights for enhancing fraud prevention strategies.
